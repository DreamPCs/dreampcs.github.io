			<h2>TECHNICAL LIBERATOR</h2>
			<hr class="grey" />
			<p class="bio">
			Technology is around us everywhere, even in places we don't suspect it. Isn't it time these devices start working for you?</p>
			<p class="bio">
			Jason is a self taught software engineer that believes we should capitalize on the sheer amount of computing power around us everyday. Most of us are under-utilizing our devices and they can be doing so much more. For instance, Jason uses a bunch of free and open source tools to host his own server that provides email, file storage, automatic photo backup among other features on a computer so old you couldn't even buy it anymore. Jason is all about liberating our use of technology.
